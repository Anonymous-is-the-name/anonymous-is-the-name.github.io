                <p>We found each other</p>
                <p>I helped you out of a broken place</p>
                <p>You gave me comfort</p>
                <p>But falling for you was my mistake</p>
                <br>
                <p>I put you on top, I put you on top</p>
                <p>I claimed you so proud and openly</p>
                <p>And when times were rough, when times were rough</p>
                <p>I made sure I held you close to me</p>
                <br>
                <p>So call out my name (call out my name)</p>
                <p>Call out my name when I kiss you so gently</p>
                <p>I want you to stay (want you to stay)</p>
                <p>I want you to stay, even though you don't want me</p>
                <br>
                <p>Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)</p>
                <p>Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?</p>
                <p>Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)</p>
                <p>Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'll be on my way</p>
